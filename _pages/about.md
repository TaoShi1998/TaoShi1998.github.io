Hi there! My name is Tao Shi (石涛 in Simplified Chinese). I obtained a Master's degree in Data Science and Information Technology from Tsinghua University in June 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Shao-Lun Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/slhuang/home). Earlier, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from China University of Mining and Technology in June 2020.

My research interests primarily lie in the intersection of natural language processing and multimodal learning.

If you are interested in discussing potential academic cooperation opportunities or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via [shitao21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:shitao21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
