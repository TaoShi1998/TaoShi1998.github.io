Hi there! My name is Tao Shi (石涛 in Simplified Chinese). I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Data Science and Information Technology at Tsinghua-UC Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI), Tsinghua University. My sueprvisor is [Prof. Shao-Lun Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/slhuang/home).

Prior to my enrollment at Tsinghua University, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from China University of Mining and Technology.

My research interests primarily lie in natural language processing, multimodal learning, and machine learning.

If you are interested in discussing potential academic cooperation opportunities or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via [shitao21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:shitao21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).
