  title={MultiEMO: An Attention-Based Correlation-Aware Multimodal Fusion Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversations},
  author={Tao Shi and Shao-Lun Huang},
  abstract={Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is an increasingly popular task in the Natural Language Processing community, which seeks to achieve accurate emotion classifications of utterances expressed by speakers during a con- versation. Most existing approaches focus on modeling speaker and contextual information based on the textual modality, while the com- plementarity of multimodal information has not been well leveraged, few current methods have sufficiently captured the complex correla- tions and mapping relationships across differ- ent modalities. Furthermore, existing state-of- the-art ERC models have difficulty classifying minority and semantically similar emotion cate- gories. To address these challenges, we propose a novel attention-based correlation-aware mul- timodal fusion framework named MultiEMO, which effectively integrates multimodal cues by capturing cross-modal mapping relation- ships across textual, audio and visual modal- ities based on bidirectional multi-head cross- attention layers. The difficulty of recognizing minority and semantically hard-to-distinguish emotion classes is alleviated by our proposed Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive (SWFC) loss. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ERC datasets demonstrate that our MultiEMO framework consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in all emotion cat- egories on both datasets, the improvements in minority and semantically similar emotions are especially significant.},
